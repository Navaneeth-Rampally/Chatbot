#Chatbot 

I have created a chatbot using python by implementing oops concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction. 

steps to create the project and execute them:
1. Create environment by using command:  python -m venv venv
2. Activate the environment by using command: venv\Scripts\activate
3. create requirements.txt where we will write the libraries and install it in the environment.
4. Now create all the necessary folders in the following way
-> Chatbot
    -> __init__.py
    -> engine.py
-> tutors
    -> __init__.py
    -> base_tutor.py
-> venv 
-> Create ".gitignore" file and mention fileswhich you want to hide and don;t want to show in github.
5. Create app.py where we will write the necessary code for running the chatbot using streamline
6. Create "config.py" where we will write the Groq Model 
7. Now execute the chatbut using streamline by using below command:
    ->  python run app.py
